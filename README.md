# Zelda-ishv1.0-demo
A demo of a zelda lookalike game I'm working on.
This game is in no way affiliated with Nintendo, and will never be for sale.

I simply love the zelda franchise and wanted to create something resembling what Nintendo created.

This should in no way be seen as a competitor for Nintendos Legend of Zelda games. Theirs is way better anyway
and I could never create a game anywhere close to the quality they've achieved.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

That being said, feel free to download the game. This game should work with linux and windows as long as you launch it correctly.
