# Zelda-ishv1.0-demo
A demo of a zelda lookalike game I'm working on.
This game is in no way affiliated with Nintendo, and will never be for sale.

I simply love the zelda franchise and wanted to create something resembling what Nintendo created.

This should in no way be seen as a competitor for Nintendos Legend of Zelda games. Theirs is way better anyway
and I could never create a game anywhere close to the quality they've achieved.

That being said, feel free to download the game. This game should work with linux and windows as long as you launch it correctly.
